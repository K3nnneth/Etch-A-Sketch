# Etch-A-Sketch

For this project, I created a game similar to the Etch-A-Sketch drawing toy using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The game is designed so a user can create a square board between 1 x 1 pixel and 100 x 100 pixels. After the board is created, when the user drags their mouse over any pixel, it will change the color of that pixel allowing the user to "draw". The last feature is an erase board button that will clear the current drawing on the board.
